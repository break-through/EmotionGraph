 # Dynamic Line Chart Library for Presenting Data using Color Gradient

This library is implemented in Paper.js and takes as input points (x-value and y-value) in a file.

It then gives back a line graph with a color gradient denoting extremely positive and extremely negative values.

Y-values are in the range [0 .. 1] and are then normalized in the range [1 .. height-1].

There is no bound for X-values as the user can scroll using mouse and also the developper can scale up the values for better accuracy and precision.
